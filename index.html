<h1>DIY rocket fuel</h1>
<p>rocket fuel, REAL rocket fuel, not the water bottle ones with bike pumps, no, real rocket fuel that ignites and flys hundreds of feet into tha air!</p>
<p>you will need: 1/2 cup of potassium nitrate (can be found in stump remover, most garden shops will sell it), 1/2 cup of white sugar, the more fine the powder, the better it 
will burn, this applies to the potassium nitrate too.</p>

<p>if the bottle of potassium nitrate is very old i recomend to bake it for 30 minutes WITHOUT the sugar, the potassium alone will only react like sugar, but if you combine both
  together the results will get... explosive</p>
  <p>i will be making a blog post about how to put the fuel into a rocket body</p>
