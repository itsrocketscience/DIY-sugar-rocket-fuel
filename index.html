<p>rocket fuel, REAL rocket fuel, not the water bottle ones with bike pumps, no, real rocket fuel that ignites and flys hundreds of feet into tha air!</p>
<p>you will need: 1/2 cup of potassium nitrate (can be found in stump remover, most garden shops will sell it), 1/2 cup of white sugar, the more fine the powder, the better it
