<h1>DIY rocket fuel</h1>
<p>rocket fuel, REAL rocket fuel, not the water bottle ones with bike pumps, no, real rocket fuel that ignites and flys hundreds of feet into tha air!</p>
<p>you will need: 1/2 cup of potassium nitrate (can be found in stump remover, most garden shops will sell it), 1/2 cup of white sugar, the more fine the powder, the better it 
will burn, this applies to the potassium nitrate too.</p>

<p>if the bottle of potassium nitrate is very old i recomend to bake it for 30 minutes WITHOUT the sugar, the potassium alone will only react like sugar, but if you combine both
  together the results will get... explosive</p>
<p>to increase the rocket power dramatically, cook the powder until it turns like dough, be aware that this rocket fuel is very dangrous and can let off a large amount of smoke</p>

<p>as you can see, make sure there are no air bubbles inside the fuel or else it will explode, in my case you can see that i poked a hol too far into the fuel and it came out the 
  other end, the whole rocket should be tigtly sealed</p>
